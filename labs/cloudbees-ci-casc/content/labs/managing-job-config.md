In addition to folders, the CloudBees CI CasC provides support for managing the configuration of certain Jenkins job types to include:

- Freestyle jobs

- Bitbucket Team/Project folders

In this lab we will export the configuration for the GitHub Organization Folder project you created in the previous lab and then add it to your configuration bundle.
